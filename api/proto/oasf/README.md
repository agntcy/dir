# OASF Package

OASF package is a local import of OASF (https://schema.oasf.agntcy.org/) gRPC package.

## Version Mapping

| OASF Version | gRPC module version |
| --- | --- |
| `v0.3.x` | `v1alpha1` |
| `v0.4.x` | `v1alpha2` |

Once the OASF schema stabilizes without breaking changes, the version mapping between the two components should be matching, ie `v1.0.0` to `v1`.
