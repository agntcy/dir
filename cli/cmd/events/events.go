var Command = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "events",
	Short: "Stream real-time system events",
	Long: `Stream real-time events from the Directory system.

This command allows you to monitor system activity by subscribing to
events from various services (store, routing, sync, signing).

Examples:

1. Listen to all events:
   dirctl events listen

2. Filter by event type:
   dirctl events listen --types RECORD_PUSHED,RECORD_PUBLISHED

3. Filter by labels:
   dirctl events listen --labels /skills/AI

4. Output in JSON format:
   dirctl events listen --json

Events are delivered from subscription time forward (no history).
The stream remains active until interrupted (Ctrl+C).
