### Framework extension

To enable interoperability between different agentic frameworks, the data about the framework can be encoded using an extension. Although additional tooling may be required, it is possible to extract certain information that can be used to provide conversion capabilities between different frameworks. Information contained in this extension can be leveraged by custom tools on the data or application layer to allow interoperability between different AI agentic frameworks.

An example extension specification for CrewAI framework is given below.
