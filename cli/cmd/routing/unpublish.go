var unpublishCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "unpublish <cid>",
	Short: "Unpublish record from the network",
	Long: `Unpublish a record from the network to stop content discovery by other peers.

This command removes a record's network announcements, making it no longer
discoverable by other peers through the DHT. The record remains in local storage.

Key Features:
- Network removal: Removes record from distributed discovery
- Local cleanup: Removes record from local routing index
- DHT cleanup: Removes record and label announcements from network
- Immediate effect: Record becomes undiscoverable by other peers

Usage examples:

1. Unpublish a record from the network:
   dirctl routing unpublish <cid>

Note: This only removes network announcements. Use 'dirctl delete' to remove the record entirely.
