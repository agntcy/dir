var Command = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "routing",
	Short: "Routing operations for record discovery and announcement",
	Long: `Routing operations for record discovery and announcement.

This command group provides access to all routing-specific operations:

- publish: Announce records to the network for discovery
- unpublish: Remove records from network discovery
- list: Query local records with filtering
- search: Discover remote records from other peers
- info: Show routing statistics and summary information

Examples:

1. Publish a record to the network:
   dirctl routing publish <cid>

2. List local records with skill filter:
   dirctl routing list --skill "AI"

3. Search for remote records across the network:
   dirctl routing search --skill "AI" --limit 10

4. Unpublish a record from the network:
   dirctl routing unpublish <cid>

This follows clear service separation - all routing API operations are grouped together.
